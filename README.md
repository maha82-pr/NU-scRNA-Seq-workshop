## Workshop Goals
- **Learn R Fundamentals**: Understand the basics of R programming, including data structures, visualization, and basic scripting.
- **Explore scRNA-Seq Analysis**: Gain an overview of single-cell RNA sequencing, its applications, and hands-on experience analyzing scRNA-Seq data.

## Agenda
1. **Introduction to R**
   - Setting up R and RStudio
   - R syntax and basic operations
   - Data visualization with ggplot2

2. **Understanding scRNA-Seq**
   - Overview of single-cell technologies
   - Preprocessing scRNA-Seq data
   - Clustering and visualization techniques

## Prerequisites
No prior experience with R or bioinformatics is required. However, familiarity with basic biology concepts will be helpful.
